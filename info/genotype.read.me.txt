READ.ME for can.x.brev

Raw sequence data can be found in the SRA Project PRJNA720109

1. align the sequence for the parents and the F2s
	
	script	align.parents.sh
	output	/align.parents
	
	script	align.genomic.multifile.sh
	output	/align.v3
	
2. call variants in the parents, identify sites homozygous for alternate alleles

	script	call.variants.parents.sh
	output	/F2.genotyp/ID.alleles
	
3. generate read counts for different alleles at variable positions

	script	counts.F2.loop.sh
	script	count.alleles.pl
	output	/F2.genotype/counts
	
4. assign ancestry to each assignable read for each F2

	script	assign.ancestry.loop.sh
	output	/ancestry
	
5. generate table of A. canadensis allele frequencies in marker bins

	script	genotype.part1.R
	output	/allele.freq.tables
	
6. convert frequencies to genotypes (A, H, B) for each bin, combine into 1 table ready for map estimation/combining with phenotypes for QTL mapping using Rqtl

	script	genotype.part2.R
	output	genotype.table.out.txt
	
7. initial map estimation done following best practices in Rqtl tutorials, however, 
	-significant improvements were made by adjusting some markers to fall in line with physical map or prior map estimates 
	- some randomness to the initial map estimate, therefore not all coded
	
8. final genetic map coordinates, genotypes, and phenotypes for F2s provided in the following file:

	canxbrev.pheno.geno.table.csv
